We leverage the popular mongodb go driver "gopkg.in/mgo.v2"

Here is the instruction to run the sample

* Properly installed Go in your operating system
* Properly set up GOPATH
* Run 'go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2' for once
* Properly set the connection string in file sql-sample.go LN #13
* Run 'go run cosmosdb-sample.go'

Cheers
